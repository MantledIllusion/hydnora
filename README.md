Hydnora is a small library for concurrent caching.

Hydnora Africana is an underground living plant. The only overground part is its insect-attrackting 
flower whose small opening leads down into the plant, trapping entering insect. Instead of digesting the 
insects like carnivorous plants would, Hydrona just pollinates and releases them once it is mature.
